  # The secret key used by Devise. Devise uses this key to generate
  # random tokens. Changing this key will render invalid all existing
  # confirmation, reset password and unlock tokens in the database.

  # by default. You can change it below and use your own secret key.

  # available as additional gems.

  # particular strategies by setting this option.
